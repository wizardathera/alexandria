### Current Sprint Focus
- **Phase 1.6**: Critical stability and functionality fixes (4/9 tasks complete)
- **Next Priority**: Task 1.65 Fix Search Endpoint Functionality
- **Key Goal**: Restore end-to-end platform functionality and resolve critical errors
- **Recent Completions**: 
  - Task 1.61 ✅ - OpenAI ImportError resolved, embedding generation working
  - Task 1.62 ✅ - Enhanced embedding service implemented with AI semantic tagging and content relationships
  - Task 1.63 ✅ - Enhanced content API endpoint 404 fixes resolved with new endpoints and error handling
  - Task 1.64 ✅ - Book upload 500 server errors completely resolved, all document formats working

### Strategic Backend Architecture Decisions

#### **1. API-First Design**
- **Decision**: Design all backend services with clean REST APIs
- **Rationale**: Enables frontend flexibility and third-party integrations
- **Impact**: Supports both Streamlit and Next.js frontends seamlessly

#### **2. Multi-Module Content Schema**
- **Decision**: Unified content schema supporting books, courses, marketplace items
- **Rationale**: Enables cross-module relationships and unified search
- **Impact**: Foundation for Phase 2 LMS and Phase 3 marketplace features

#### **3. Permission-First RAG Architecture**
- **Decision**: All RAG operations include user permission filtering
- **Rationale**: Enables seamless transition to multi-user platform
- **Impact**: Avoids major refactoring when activating multi-user features

#### **4. Migration-Ready Database Layer**
- **Decision**: Abstract vector database operations behind interface
- **Rationale**: Enables seamless Chroma → Supabase migration
- **Impact**: Reduced risk and complexity for production deployment

### Performance Requirements

#### **Current Phase (1.4)**
- Query response time: <3 seconds for 95% of RAG queries
- Search relevance: >85% user satisfaction with results
- Concurrent users: Support 10+ simultaneous queries
- API response time: <500ms for metadata operations

#### **Phase 2 Production**
- Query response time: <2 seconds for 95% of queries
- Concurrent users: Support 100+ simultaneous queries
- Database migrations: Zero-downtime deployment capability
- API availability: 99.9% uptime target

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### **Technical Risks**
- **Vector Database Migration**: Dual-write validation ensures data consistency
- **Performance Degradation**: Comprehensive benchmarking validates improvements
- **API Breaking Changes**: Version-aware endpoints prevent compatibility issues
- **Data Loss**: Complete backup and rollback strategies implemented

#### **Scalability Risks**
- **User Growth**: Design patterns support horizontal scaling
- **Content Volume**: Efficient indexing and caching strategies implemented
- **Query Complexity**: Performance testing with realistic data volumes
- **Resource Usage**: Cost monitoring and optimization for AI services

## 📋 Backend Task Renumbering Log

**Date**: 2025-07-05

During Phase 1.63 completion, backend tasks were renumbered to maintain sequential order and add missing tasks from the planning documents. The following changes were made:

| Old Number | New Number | Task Title |
|------------|------------|------------|
| 1.62 | 1.63 | Fix /api/enhanced/content 404 Endpoint |
| 1.63 | 1.64 | Fix Book Upload 500 Server Error |
| 1.64 | 1.65 | Fix Search Endpoint Functionality |
| 1.66 | 1.67 | Fix Content Relationships Explorer Backend |
| 1.67 | 1.68 | Fix Reading Analytics Dashboard Backend |
| N/A | 1.66 | Fix Q&A Chat Empty State (newly added) |
| N/A | 1.69 | Fix Theme Modes Visual Consistency (newly added) |
| 1.45 | 1.70 | Multi-Module RAG Query System Integration |
| 1.47 | 1.71 | User Permission Integration |

**Rationale**: 
- Task 1.62 was completed as "Enhanced embedding service implementation" and the former task 1.62 (API endpoint fix) was renumbered to 1.63
- Missing Phase 1.6 tasks 1.66 and 1.69 were added from PLANNING_OVERVIEW.md
- Phase 1.4 deferred tasks were renumbered to follow sequential order after Phase 1.6 tasks
- All dependency references were updated to reflect new task numbers
