# üìã Alexandria Platform Roadmap Notes & History

## üìö Historical Context

This document contains archived sections, historical decisions, and notes from earlier roadmap drafts to maintain context and institutional knowledge as the Alexandria platform evolves.

## üóìÔ∏è Roadmap Evolution History

### Original Roadmap Creation
**Date**: 2025-07-04  
**Context**: Initial comprehensive roadmap created to guide Alexandria platform development from MVP through enterprise scale.

**Key Historical Decisions**:
- **Technology Choice**: Streamlit ‚Üí Next.js migration path chosen for rapid prototyping followed by production scalability
