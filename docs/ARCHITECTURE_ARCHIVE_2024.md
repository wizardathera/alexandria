- [Frontend Architecture](ARCHITECTURE_FRONTEND.md)
- [Backend Architecture](ARCHITECTURE_BACKEND.md)
- [Data Model & Storage](ARCHITECTURE_DATA_MODEL.md)
- [AI Services & RAG](ARCHITECTURE_AI_SERVICES.md)

## üóÑÔ∏è Deprecated Database Approaches

### Original SQLite Schema (Superseded by PostgreSQL)

**Status**: Deprecated in Phase 1.3, replaced by Supabase PostgreSQL

The initial MVP used SQLite for local development simplicity. This approach was superseded by PostgreSQL with Supabase for production scalability.

```sql
-- Original SQLite schema (deprecated)
CREATE TABLE books_old (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    author TEXT,
    file_path TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE book_chunks_old (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    book_id INTEGER REFERENCES books_old(id),
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    chunk_index INTEGER,
    embedding BLOB  -- Stored as binary data
);
```

**Migration Path**: Data migrated to enhanced PostgreSQL schema with UUID primary keys and JSONB metadata support.

### Original Chroma Vector Storage (Superseded by Supabase pgvector)

**Status**: Deprecated in Phase 1.35, replaced by Supabase pgvector

The initial vector storage used local Chroma database files. This was replaced by Supabase pgvector for production deployment and enhanced metadata support.

```python
# Original Chroma implementation (deprecated)
class OriginalChromaService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = chromadb.Client()
        self.collection = self.client.create_collection("book_embeddings")
    
    def add_embeddings(self, texts, embeddings, metadatas):
        # Simple metadata structure - limited compared to current implementation
        self.collection.add(
            documents=texts,
            embeddings=embeddings,
            metadatas=metadatas,
            ids=[str(uuid.uuid4()) for _ in texts]
        )
```

**Migration Completed**: Full migration to Supabase pgvector with enhanced metadata schema and multi-module support.

## üé® Deprecated Frontend Approaches

### Original Streamlit File Structure (Superseded by Enhanced Structure)

**Status**: Deprecated in Phase 1.2, replaced by modular component architecture

The initial Streamlit application used a simple file structure that was enhanced for better maintainability.

```
# Original structure (deprecated)
streamlit_app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chat.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ upload.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.py
```

**Current Structure**: Enhanced modular structure with separate pages, components, and utilities directories for better organization.

### Basic Session State Management (Superseded by Enhanced State)

**Status**: Deprecated in Phase 1.2, replaced by structured state management

The original session state used simple key-value storage without type safety or structure.

```python
# Original session state (deprecated)
if 'books' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.books = []

if 'current_book' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.current_book = None
```

**Current Approach**: Structured session state with type hints and proper state management patterns.

## üîß Deprecated API Approaches

### Original FastAPI Routes (Superseded by Module-Based Routing)

**Status**: Deprecated in Phase 1.3, replaced by modular API structure

The initial API used simple route definitions without module separation.

```python
# Original API structure (deprecated)
@app.post("/upload")
async def upload_book(file: UploadFile):
    # Simple upload handling
    pass

@app.post("/query")
async def query_book(query: str, book_id: str):
    # Basic query processing
    pass
```

**Current Structure**: Module-based routing with `/library/`, `/lms/`, and `/marketplace/` namespaces for better organization.

### Simple Error Handling (Superseded by Comprehensive Error Management)

**Status**: Deprecated in Phase 1.2, replaced by structured error handling

The original error handling used basic try-catch blocks without proper error categorization.

```python
# Original error handling (deprecated)
try:
    result = process_request()
    return result
except Exception as e:
    return {"error": str(e)}
```

**Current Approach**: Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes, error categories, and user-friendly messages.

## ü§ñ Deprecated AI/RAG Approaches

### Simple Embedding Strategy (Superseded by Multi-Strategy Approach)

**Status**: Deprecated in Phase 1.2, replaced by hybrid retrieval

The initial RAG implementation used simple vector similarity search without hybrid approaches.

```python
# Original RAG implementation (deprecated)
class SimpleRAG:
    def search(self, query: str, k: int = 5):
        query_embedding = self.embedding_model.encode(query)
        results = self.vector_db.similarity_search(query_embedding, k=k)
        return results
```

**Current Approach**: Hybrid retrieval combining vector search, keyword search, and graph traversal for improved accuracy.

### Basic Prompt Templates (Superseded by Dynamic Prompt Engineering)

**Status**: Deprecated in Phase 1.3, replaced by context-aware prompt generation

The original prompt templates were static and didn't adapt to context or user preferences.

```python
# Original prompt template (deprecated)
BASIC_TEMPLATE = """
Based on the following context, answer the question:

Context: {context}
Question: {question}
Answer:
"""
```

**Current Approach**: Dynamic prompt engineering with personality adaptation, context awareness, and module-specific templates.

## üì± Deprecated UI/UX Patterns

### Basic Streamlit Styling (Superseded by Enhanced Theming)

**Status**: Deprecated in Phase 1.2, replaced by comprehensive theme system

The original UI used basic Streamlit components without custom styling or theming.

```python
# Original styling (deprecated)
st.title("Book Companion")
st.write("Upload your book below:")
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose a file")
```

**Current Approach**: Enhanced theming system with multiple reading environments, custom CSS, and user personalization.

### Simple File Upload (Superseded by Advanced Upload System)

**Status**: Deprecated in Phase 1.1, replaced by drag-and-drop with validation

The original file upload used basic Streamlit file uploader without validation or progress tracking.

```python
# Original upload (deprecated)
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a book", type=['pdf', 'txt'])
if uploaded_file:
    process_file(uploaded_file)
```

**Current Approach**: Advanced upload system with drag-and-drop, file validation, progress tracking, and multiple format support.
